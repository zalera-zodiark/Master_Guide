# Build adaptive apps with Jetpack Compose

In this code lab you learn how to build adaptive apps for phones, tablets, and foldable, and how they enhance reachability with Jetpack Compose. You also learn best practices for using Material 3 components and theming.

Before we dive in, it's important to understand what we mean by adaptability.

## Adaptability

The UI for your app should be responsive to account for different screen sizes, orientations and form factors. An adaptive layout changes based on the screen space available to it. These changes range from simple layout adjustments to fill up space, choosing respective navigation styles, to changing layouts completely to make use of additional room.

In this codelab you explore how to use and think about adaptability when using Jetpack Compose. You build an application, called Reply, that shows you how to implement adaptability for all kinds of screens, and how adaptability and reachability work together to give users an optimal experience.

## What you'll learn

* How to design your app to target all screen sizes with Jetpack Compose
